# Samuel Owusu's Website phase 1
Project Description
What does your application do?
This is a personal website created by Samuel Owusu, showcasing his portfolio, about information, contact details, and links to other important pages. The website is built using HTML and styled with an external CSS file.

What technologies did you use and why?

HTML: To structure the content of the website (headings, paragraphs, links, etc.).
CSS: For styling and layout purposes, improving the visual presentation of the website.
No JavaScript: This simple website doesn't include JavaScript at the moment but can be extended later with interactive features.
Challenges
The main challenge in this project was designing a clean layout with proper navigation links and organizing the content in a way that is easy to navigate and understand. There was also a need to ensure proper responsiveness for different screen sizes (though this may be added later).

Future features

Adding JavaScript for interactivity (e.g., form validation or a slideshow for featured work).
Implementing responsiveness for mobile and tablet devices.
Adding animations and transitions to enhance user experience.
